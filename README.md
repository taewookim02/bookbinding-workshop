# Bookbinding-workshop

This project serves 2 purposes

- Practicing Figma, Sass
- Handover for a part-time job I had

## I learned:

- Image sizes and font sizes may look okay-ish in Figma, but when coded it may not be okay looking. So I had to change the font-sizes when coding them
- That getting used to BEM methodology is probably a good idea because the class naming wasnâ€™t as consistent as I wanted them to be
- That it would be helpful to study more on Sass architecture for websites with multiple pages
